<h3>Welcome!</h3>

Welcome to the *Craft of Electronics*. If you have never explored electricity and electronics before, and you enjoy making things, then this course was designed for you. We designed this course with three long-term goals in mind:

1. **We want to build things**. If you can hold a pencil, you can build a circuit. *Learning to think with our hands* is an important part of how we learn electronics.
1. **We need to plan**. We will begin by building things other people have designed, and (over time) learn how to design new things ourselves.
1. **We want to be safe in everything we do**. Electricity is not dangerous... but people who do not respect electricity *are* dangerous. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
