## Course Description

## Enduring Understandings
If this was the *only* course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what do we hope you will remember 10 years from now?

1. Remember to respect electricity in all its forms, and work with it safely.
1. Remember that you can build and repair electronics using tools easily obtained.
1. Remember that electronics are not magic, but with a little bit of theory and research, you can understand any electrical or electronic system you encounter.

It might be that you remember more; at the least, you must leave this course having learned that you can work with electrical systems safely, but it takes attention and care on your part.
