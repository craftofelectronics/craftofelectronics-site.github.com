## Course Description

## Enduring Understandings
If this was the *only* course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what do we hope you will remember 10 years from now?

<br/>
<div class="alert alert-success">
  Respect electricity in all its forms, and work with it safely.
</div>

<br/>
<div class="alert alert-success">
  <b>You</b> can build and repair electronics using tools easily obtained.
</div>

<br/>
<div class="alert alert-success">
  With a little theory and research, you can understand any electrical or electronic system you encounter.
</div>
<br/>

It might be that you remember more; at the least, you must leave this course having learned that you can work with electrical systems safely, but it takes attention and care on your part.
